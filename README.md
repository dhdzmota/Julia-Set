# Julia-Set
## (by Daniel Hern√°ndez Mota)
This repository includes text, code and some images of the Julia Set. 

The text is a brief and simple explanation of what are fractals, some of their properties and finally an introduction of how the Julia sets are formed. There is also an explanation on how does the code is used to generate this marvelous structures.
There is also a jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the code on python3. 
The final outcome is a pdf file where all the information is joined.
